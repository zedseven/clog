A utility for pulling information from the Git commit log of a repo, then processing it into actionable data.
The name comes from the phrase "Commit Log", but you can also think of it as the variety of shoe.

It works by calling `git log` internally then processing the data, following referenced commit revisions, collecting
Jira tickets, etc., then displaying the information in a useful way.

This tool relies on the line that `git-svn` adds to the end of every commit message when its `--metadata` flag is
provided, which contains the SVN URL and revision number.

It can also generate an SVN to Git revision map from this information, in Markdown or in binary format
([similar to what `git-svn` itself uses](https://github.com/git/git/blob/eea7033409a0ed713c78437fc76486983d211e25/perl/Git/SVN.pm#L2188-L2214)).

Please note that this tool is somewhat specialised, and may not be useful out of the box for other people's use-cases.
